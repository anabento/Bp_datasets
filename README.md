# Bp-example-datasets
Bp isolate sequences for OR, NY and MN

SNPs were called in each state dataset separately (MN, NY, OR) – do you also need them combined? (it’s not hard). Alignments and trees also include “Reference” which matches Bp_C374_Illumina_final_ISmasked.fasta.
 
Bp-example-datasets.tsv -- Year of isolation, state, and public accession numbers
 
20191218-core-MN.full.biosample.0[1234].aln.gz – Full-length alignment (4.1 Mbp) with SNPs incorporated in to reference genome (C734) for each isolate.
 
20191219-core-MN.biosample.aln – Alignment of core variable positions only (see lengths below).
 
20191219-core-MN.biosample.fasttree.tre – Newick tree calculated from core variable positions, just for a quick snap shot of each dataset.
 
 
MN – 260 isolates – 360 variable sites
NY – 165 isolates – 313 variable sites
OR – 201 isolates – 254 variable sites
